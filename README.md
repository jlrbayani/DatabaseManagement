CPSC Project - Database Management: 

This was a project made in a class of mine. I worked with a partner, and our job was 
to implement a way to create a backend for handling course lookup with various 
bits of information on each one (ie. room, room size, name, unique tags). 

I worked on the main implemention for handling a tree like structure for the search
functionality of the application while my partner worked on the framework for
the underlying database matrix to handle the information we were working with. 

Together, we also worked on a user interface to easily use our end application
that ended up utilizing HTTP request methods. 

Overall, the experience was a great way of learning how to balance a project with someone
else. This also gave me a lot of exposure to Typescript, its promises functionality, and HTTP
requests.
